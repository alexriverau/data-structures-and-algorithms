# Reverse an Array

Write a function called reverseArray ("reverse_list" in python) which takes an array (list) as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array (list) with elements in reversed order.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach taken for this Code Challenge was to iterate over the list elements backwards, add them to a new list and return the new list.

**BigO**
* Time - O(n) because we will be iterating over all elements of the list
* Space - O(n) because we created a new list with the same amount of items
