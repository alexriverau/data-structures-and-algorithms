# Linked List kth from end

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

**kth from end**
* Arguments: a number, `k`, as a parameter.
* Return the nodeâ€™s value that is `k` places from the tail of the linked list.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

**BigO**
* Time - O(n) because we are traversing twice but 2n reduces to O(n)
* Space - O(1) because we are only storing a few variables not related to input size

## Solution
