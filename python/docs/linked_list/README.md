# Singly Linked List

Singly Linked List implementation and testing.

## Challenge

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Create a Linked List class that includes a head property.
  * Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * Create insert method
    * Arguments: value
    * Returns: nothing
    * Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Create includes method
    * Arguments: value
    * Returns: Boolean
    * Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Create to string method
    * Arguments: none
    * Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> None"

## Testing
